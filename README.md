## Why This Project is Important
I had to synthesize information from a variety of disparate sources. From this synthesis, I had to tailor the learning content to the learning outcomes of the organization's target audience (employed and contract workers) and adhere to best practices of pedagogical and professional development. I also had to measure learning outcomes based on established quantitative methods.

This project also shows my skill with visual media and graphic design that supports or supplements the communication of concepts through writing.

## Methodology
The topic is safety for flat roof design and operations. Course content is based on public legislative and building code knowledge, and organizational work experience in building science and asset management.
